2. OpenSSL versions supported (Unix)
------------------------------------

   SSL enabled dispatcher versions (indicated by a '-ssl1.x-' in the
   package name) depend on the OpenSSL libraries installed on your
   target machine. There are two versions of SSL enabled dispatcher
   distributions:

   - if you still have OpenSSL 1.0.2, use the distribution package
     that has a -ssl1.0- in its name
   - if you already have OpenSSL 1.1.x, use the distribution package
     that has a -ssl1.1- in its name

   For more information see:

3. Installation (IIS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dispatcher 4.1.11 and later no longer supports Microsoft Internet
   Information Server (IIS) 7.x or lower: 8.0 or higher is required.

   Dispatcher no longer requires to be installed as an ISAPI filter.
   Instead, it should be installed like a wildcard application on a
   site level.

   In IIS 8.x and IIS 10:

      Follow the steps for IIS 7.x outlined above, then:

      1. Select your added handler, click "Edit Script Map".

      2. In the dialog, click on the button "Request Restrictions..."

      3. On the "Mapping" tab, clear the chechbox "Invoke handler
         only if request is mapped to:". This ensures that the
         handler is also invoked for non-existing files or folders.

      4. Click OK.


4. Additional installation steps (IIS) for SSL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you have a distribution package containing SSL support (indicated
   by a '-ssl1.x-' in the package name), you'll need to install some
   additonal libraries:

   1. Navigate to the following location in your browser:

      https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html

   2. Follow links to download OpenSSL v1.0.2 or OpenSSL v1.1.x.

      Note that www.openssl.org no longer provides binary distributions. To
      obtain binaries you must either download them from a mirror site
      or download the source code and follow instructions to build it.

   3. When downloading from a mirror site, make sure it includes the dll files
      "ssleay32.dll" and "libeay32.dll" for OpenSSL 1.0, or
      "libcrypto.dll" and "libssl.dll" for OpenSSL 1.1.

   4. Extract above mentioned dll files to the same location where you
      extracted the dispatcher binary "disp_iis.dll" to.


5. Apache 2.2 no longer supported
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Dispatcher version 4.2.3 was the last version supporting Apache 2.2.

   Adobe has dropped support for Apache 2.2 after December 2017, and
   recommends to upgrade to Apache 2.4.

   In case you stay with Apache 2.2 beyond December 2017, it is recommended
   to use a Linux distribution that commits to Apache 2.2 security updates.

   The last dispatcher release of 2017 for Apache 2.2 will still be
   available for download until end of 2018.


6. Solaris and AIX no longer supported
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Adobe has dropped support for Solaris and AIX with AEM 6.5.

   Dispatcher version 4.3.2 was the last version supporting those
   operating systems.


7. Mac OS X (Darwin) support
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Apache 2.4 Dispatcher module for Mac OS X is built against
   the Apache provided by brew. It will not work in the Apache
   distributions preinstalled by default.

   For further information on how to install brew and its Apache
   binary, consult conf/README.md in your distribution package.


8. Online documentation
